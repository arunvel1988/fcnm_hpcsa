SRP (SCSI RDMA Protocol) and SDB (SCSI Disk Block) over InfiniBand are used for accessing storage devices over an InfiniBand network. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what they mean and how they work:

SRP (SCSI RDMA Protocol)
Definition:

SRP is a protocol that allows SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) commands to be transported over RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) networks, such as InfiniBand.
Purpose:

The main purpose of SRP is to provide high-performance access to storage devices by enabling the direct transfer of data from one memory space to another without involving the CPU, thereby reducing latency and CPU overhead.
Functionality:

SRP allows initiators (clients) to send SCSI commands to targets (storage devices) over the InfiniBand network. The targets respond to these commands directly, which can improve data throughput and performance compared to traditional SCSI over TCP/IP.
Use Cases:

SRP is commonly used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, where low-latency access to storage is crucial. It is suitable for applications that require fast data access, such as databases and large-scale data processing.
SDB (SCSI Disk Block)
Definition:

SDB, in the context of InfiniBand and SRP, refers to the abstraction of SCSI storage devices as block devices that can be accessed over the InfiniBand network.
Purpose:

It allows operating systems and applications to treat remote SCSI devices as if they were local block devices, making it easier to integrate storage resources over the network.
Functionality:

When using SDB with SRP, the operating system can read from and write to remote SCSI storage as if it were accessing a local hard drive. This provides a seamless experience for applications that rely on block storage.
How They Work Together
Integration: SRP and SDB work together to provide remote block storage access. The operating system uses SDB to represent remote SCSI devices, while SRP handles the communication between the initiator and the target over the InfiniBand network.

Benefits:

By utilizing SRP over InfiniBand, organizations can achieve higher throughput, lower latency, and improved resource utilization in their storage systems. This is especially beneficial in environments with heavy data processing and storage needs.


KADAP (Kernel-based Adaptive Distributed Atomic Protocol) is a protocol designed to enhance the performance of distributed applications, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. It works over networks like InfiniBand and is used for efficient communication and data transfer in distributed systems.

Key Features of KADAP:
Atomic Operations:

KADAP supports atomic operations, which ensure that a series of operations on distributed data either all succeed or all fail, maintaining data integrity across multiple nodes.
Adaptive Communication:

The protocol adapts to network conditions and load, optimizing data transfer paths and improving throughput and latency.
Efficiency:

By leveraging RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), KADAP minimizes CPU overhead during data transfers, allowing direct memory access between nodes without involving the CPU for data copying.
Integration with RDMA Networks:

KADAP is designed to work seamlessly with RDMA-capable networks like InfiniBand, making it suitable for environments where low latency and high bandwidth are critical.
Scalability:

The protocol scales well with the increasing number of nodes in a distributed system, ensuring efficient data sharing and communication.
Use Cases:
High-Performance Computing (HPC): KADAP is particularly useful in HPC applications where performance and efficiency are critical, such as scientific simulations, data analysis, and real-time processing.
Distributed Databases: It can be applied in distributed database systems where atomic transactions and fast data access are essential.
Conclusion:
KADAP provides a robust and efficient way to handle distributed data operations, leveraging advanced network capabilities and adaptive communication techniques. It is particularly beneficial in high-performance environments that require low-latency communication and reliable data integrity across multiple nodes.
